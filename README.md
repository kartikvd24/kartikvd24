## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kartik Desai!

🎓 Electronics & Communication Engineering student at **Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering**, Bengaluru  
💻 Passionate about building **smart, real-world solutions using microcontrollers and edge AI**
💡 Embedded Systems Lead at **The Point Seven** – DSCE’s VLSI & Embedded Systems Club

## 🔧 About Me

I love taking hardware and turning it into something that **thinks, reacts, and evolves**.Whether it's a pipeline-inspecting bot crawling through narrow spaces or a voice-guided robotic assistant navigating a college campus, I design intelligent systems that sense their environment, process data at the edge, and respond in real time — all with minimal human intervention.
I'm also deeply interested in automotive technology, where embedded systems, sensors, and real-time decision-making converge to create the future of smart, connected, and autonomous vehicles.

> I combine the power of **Embedded C**, **IoT**, and **Machine Learning** to create next-gen embedded solutions.

## 🚀 Projects That Define Me

### 🔍 Automated Blockage Detection Bot
Detects pipeline blockages in real-time using **ESP32-CAM**, **YOLO**, and **Edge Impulse**, while streaming video and GPS location.

### 🪴 Smart Agriculture with LoRaWAN
Built a long-range monitoring system using **LoRa**, **ESP8266**, and multiple sensors — enabling smarter, connected farms.

### 🧠 [Text-to-Image Generator (GAN)](https://github.com/kartikvd24/Text-to-Image-Generation-using-GAN)
Generated realistic bird images from text using a **StackGAN** trained on the **CUB dataset** — showcasing creative AI on the edge.

### 🗺️ Robotic Pedestrian Guide – DSCE Campus
Voice-controlled navigation robot powered by **Raspberry Pi**, **Google Maps**, and **QR code input** for indoor campus directions.

### 📦 [Microcontroller & Sensor Detection](https://github.com/kartikvd24/Object-detection-using-ESP32-CAM-and-Edge-impulse)
Built an object detection model using Edge Impulse to identify various components like ESP32, Arduino Uno, DS18B20, and LoRa modules using a webcam or ESP32-CAM.
Useful for smart lab inventory, embedded education, and component recognition systems.
